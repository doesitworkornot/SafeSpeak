# SafeSpeak
## SafeSpeak-2024 is a hackathon focused on advancing audio spoofing detection technologies for secure voice authentication resolving arising challenges in the field of voice anti-spoofing and presentation attack detection. Competition challenges participants to develop lightweight, high-performance models capable of detecting audio spoofing attacks.

With a strong focus on computational efficiency and real-world applicability, participants will be evaluated using on ASVspoof metrics to ensure their models meet industry standards for robustness and accuracy.

Itâ€™s a unique opportunity for students to apply their skills in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and signal processing to tackle one of the most critical challenges in voice security today. By building innovative, resource-efficient models, participants will help pave the way for more secure voice authentication systems worldwide.
